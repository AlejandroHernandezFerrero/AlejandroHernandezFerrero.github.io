            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Computer engineer passionate about the design and implementation of efficient, elegant and high added value software applications.</p>
            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>As a freelance, I have carried out multiple projects of all sorts, which has allowed me to acquire a deeper understanding of software development, optimisation and computer science in general. I learned to develop memory-efficient applications for mobile devices, to build servers with Spring, its deployment in AWS, and its security protocols and communication with the client, as well as the use of several graphic libraries such as React, Swing and OpenGL, to create usable and attractive user interfaces. And ultimately, to be able to solve any problem that arose, regardless of its nature or complexity, from processing and ingesting massive volumes of data, to artificial intelligence systems.</p>
